# ðŸš— Car Prices Analysis â€“ Python Assignment

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of my Python learning journey.  
Using a **car prices dataset (`car_prices.csv`)**, I answered a set of questions (from `Problem_Statement_Python.pdf`) step by step in a **Jupyter Notebook**.  

The main goals were:
- Perform **data cleaning & preprocessing**
- Explore **statistical summaries**
- Apply **filtering, grouping, and aggregations**
- Create **visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, etc.)**
- Derive meaningful **insights about car pricing trends**

---
I have also answered the questions that are asked in the PDF file that was attached in the repository.
